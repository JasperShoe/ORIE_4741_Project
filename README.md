The question we want to answer is the following: How can we predict the value of the S&P 500? To answer this question we will be using the S&P 500 SPY dataset (which can be reached at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gkitchen/s-and-p-500-spy) in order to forecast and model our predictions and risk using methods weâ€™ve learned in class. The S&P 500 is widely regarded as a benchmark for the US stock market, and its value is closely monitored by investors, financial analysts, and policymakers. Predicting the future value of the S&P 500 SPY can help investors make informed decisions about buying or selling stocks, optimize their investment portfolios, and manage their risk exposure.

In order to model our predictions we will use variables such as dates, open and closing prices, volume traded, etc. We will also look into combining this data with other data in order to see if this can help us create more accurate models and predictions.

It is worth it to work on this problem because it can allow investors to make smarter investments and create value out of the money they put in. We will succeed because we have learned many new methods in ORIE 4741 and think they are especially helpful in answering questions related to predicting the future.
