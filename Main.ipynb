    "First, we must decide what we are trying to predict. Our dataset supplies us with four options: open, high, low, and close. Predicting the high and low values of the stock on a given day is a seemingly good idea, but this information is hard to use because it is also dependent on time - and we aren't given any data on when the stock hits either extremity. Predicting the value of the stock when the market opens is definitely useful, but it generally doesn't reflect the overall market sentiment and may be heavily influenced by unpredictable overnight news or events. On the other hand, the closing price of a stock reflects the overall market sentiment and demand for the stock at the end of the trading day. It is also widely used as a benchmark for measuring the performance of the stock market. Thus, we will be predicting the closing price."
